## Bio

I got my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Nevada, Reno. After graduation, I spent several years working as a patent agent doing patent preparation and prosecution. I then traveled the world, and got a lecturer position at Sunway University in Malaysia. 

My research interests are machine learning and evolutionary computation.
